# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
    For the Module 1 weekly challenge we are analyzing Louise’s Kickstarter dataset for entertainment fundraising campaigns. Through analyzing this data set I am visualizing campaign outcomes based on their launch date and fundraising goals. I will be utilizing tables and charts to review the data. 

### Purpose
    The purpose of this challenge is to show the dataset in an easily digestible way that allows the viewer to see the relationship between campaign outcomes, launch date and the fundraising goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
	Using the dataset, I already organized and combed through I used pivot tables, excel functions and charts to further analyze the Kickstarter dataset. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    Using pivot tables and line charts I was able to show the relationship between theater outcomes and launch date. Utilizing these tools show the data in both a numerical and visual way. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    Using CountIf functions and charts I was able to show the relationship between plays and their outcomes filtered by fundraising goal. Both the table and chart depict the same data but in slightly different ways – visual vs numerical. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	I did not encounter any challenges or difficulties. Some potential challenged or difficulties could include selecting the wrong columns for the charts resulting in inaccurate representation of the data 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    1. In general the summer months were a more successful time for launch dates. 
    2. Overall there were significantly more successful launches than failed or canceled and this can be easily seen with the line chart 
	
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    1. By analyzing the graph, the successful and failed trends are mirrors of each other. That is because the canceled percentage was zero across the board so we are really only looking at two trends. 
    2. Successful and Failed fluctuate as the goal increases. There are three different times when they are both at 50% and then either raise or lower. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    Some limitations to look out for with this dataset is limited sample size for certain categories, unreliable data gathered or self-reported data, and the potential of missing data that would impact the data set. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    A box and whisker chart would be a good tool if we were trying to see the mean median and mode or fundraising outcomes for certain categories. 
    Stacked or side by side bar graphs would also be beneficial in comparing two categories next to each other.
